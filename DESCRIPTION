Description: Regional granularity levels in Norway which are depicted by different codes, 
             have undergone several changes over the years. 
             Identifying when codes have changed and how many changes have taken place
             can be troublesome. This package will help to identify these changes and when the changes
             have taken place. One of the limitation of this package is that it is heavily depending 
             on the codes available from Statistics Norway (SSB) website <https://data.ssb.no/api/klass/v1/api-guide.html>.
